This is a sudoku solver written back in the day, with an
admittedly terrible user interface.  I don't know how I thought this would
be usuable.

However, the functionality does work.

"Solve" tries to solve using some basic logical methods.
"Brute Force Hax" does a recursive depth first search of the solution.
